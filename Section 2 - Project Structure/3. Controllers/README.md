# Project Structure | Controllers

In this video, we create a controller file and handle the _click_ event of our button. We display a **MessageToast** control with a message when the button is clicked.

We need controllers to add additional functionalities to views such as interractivity.

If the view is just displaying information and no additional functionality is required, no controller is needed.

### Conventions

- Controller names are capitalized
- Controllers carry the same name as the related view (if there is a 1:1 relationship)
- Controller names always end with \*.controller.js
